### Using Class-Based Views (CBVs)

```pycon
# yourapp/views.py

from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status

class MyAPIView(APIView):
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Handle GET request
        return Response({'message': 'This is a GET request'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Handle POST request
        return Response({'message': 'This is a POST request'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

    def put(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Handle PUT request
        return Response({'message': 'This is a PUT request'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

    def delete(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Handle DELETE request
        return Response({'message': 'This is a DELETE request'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

# yourapp/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import MyAPIView

urlpatterns = [
    path('my-endpoint/', MyAPIView.as_view(), name='my_api_view'),
]

```

### Working of Middlewares

1. Yes, middlewares in Django are called in series, one after another. The order in which they are defined in the MIDDLEWARE setting in settings.py
2. Request Phase: When a request comes in, Django processes the request by calling each middleware in the order they are listed in the MIDDLEWARE setting.
3. View Phase: After passing through all the middleware, the request reaches the view.
4. Response Phase: The response generated by the view then passes back through each middleware in reverse order.


---

### View-Specific Middleware-Like Behavior:
1. `Decorators`: Apply additional functionality to function-based views.
2. `Mixins`: Add reusable functionality to class-based views.
3. `Function`: Wrappers: Wrap views with additional processing logic.
